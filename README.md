Housing Real Estate Prediction Project

Overview
Welcome to the Housing Real Estate Prediction Project! This repository contains my initial foray into the world of machine learning, focusing on predicting housing prices using various models. As a beginner in machine learning, this project serves as a practical learning experience where I explore different algorithms and methodologies for making accurate predictions.

Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to predict housing prices based on various features using three different models:

Random Forest
Linear Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
By comparing the performance of these models, I aim to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and improve my machine learning skills.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or higher
Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/housing-real-estate-prediction.git
cd housing-real-estate-prediction
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
For this project, I used the California Housing Prices dataset. Download the dataset and place it in the data directory.

Usage
Data Exploration
Start by exploring the dataset using the 01-data-exploration.ipynb notebook. This step includes loading the data, checking for missing values, and visualizing the distribution of different features.

Linear Regression
The 02-linear-regression.ipynb notebook contains the implementation of the Linear Regression model. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Random Forest
In the 03-random-forest.ipynb notebook, you will find the implementation of the Random Forest model. Similar to the Linear Regression notebook, it covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Support Vector Regression
The 04-support-vector-regression.ipynb notebook demonstrates the use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) for predicting housing prices. This notebook also includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The performance of each model is compared to determine which one provides the most accurate predictions.

Conclusion
This project is a great starting point for anyone new to machine learning. It provides hands-on experience with different algorithms and a deeper understanding of the predictive modeling process. I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improving this project.
